        "\n",
        "Lists in Python are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. They are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation. Here's how you can access, modify, and delete elements in a list:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Accessing Elements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Using Index:** You can access individual elements using their index, starting from 0 for the first element.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
        "     print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10 (first element)\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "*2. Modifying Elements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Direct Assignment:** You can change the value of an element by assigning a new value to its index.\n",
        "\n",

        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",

        "**3. Deleting Elements:**\n",

        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",

        "     ```\n",

        "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 30]\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **`pop()` Method:** You can remove and return an element at a specific index using the `pop()` method. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- List indexing starts at 0.\n",
        "- Negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list.\n",
        "- You can modify elements using direct assignment.\n",
        "- `del`, `remove()`, and `pop()` are used to delete elements.\n",
